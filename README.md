1. **_Crack three eggs over a bowl._**

 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. **_Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl._**

 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. **_Rub the salmon vigorously with butter._**

   By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.
4. **_Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl._**

   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   * Make sure no trout or children are present
   * Use both hands
   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes


1. Cut the cheese

 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes
 
  Be careful when holding the knife.

 For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.




Visually this is a hard break by adding a space

Between 

Text

but if you want a softbreak add two spaces after each line in a paragraph (you can't see it)
